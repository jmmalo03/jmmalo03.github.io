MNIST was once widely-used to benchmark image recognition models, and is still occasionally used in contemporary research to test exploratory ideas.  It is useful for testing such ideas because it is a relatively small dataset, so that prototyping can be done (computationally) very quickly. Your goal will be to solve the MNIST problem (i.e., classify these images as accurately as possible) using custom-built deep learning models.  \n","\n","The problems here will be similar to the PyTorch 60-minute Blitz, except that the dataset we will use is different (i.e., MNIST instead of PASCAL VOC) and I will ask you to build some custom networks that are somewhat different than the ones discussed in the PyTorch Blitz.  To test your understanding, I will ask you to fill in key missing components of code I have provided, or write code from scratch.  During this assignment we will also demonstrate the advantages of some important deep learning building blocks. \n","\n","This assignment is designed so that you should be able to fill in the missing code if you (i) fully understand the 60-minute blitz, and (ii) spend a little time carefully considering the questions (and perhaps employ a little trial and error as well).  When I say \"fully understand the blitz\", I mean that you not only copied the code and ran it without error, but that you understand well what the code in the blitz is doing!  The 60-minute blitz may sometimes be entirely clear, and therefore it is reasonable if you find yourself sometimes reading about neural network structures and pytorch outside of the 60-minute blitz (e.g., The PyTorch website has myriad examples and great tutorials). \n","\n","**Instructions.** This assignment will be worth 100 points.
