  <h1>Final Project</h1>
  <h2>Summary and Goals</h2>
    <p>Machine Learning tools are not an end in themselves, but yield value when making predictions, quantifying and describing phenomena in the world around us, and in all these ways and more helping us to make decisions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. For this final project, <b>you will work in teams of 1 or 2 students</b> to (1) identify a problem to solve or a question to answer, (2) apply machine learning techniques to conduct experiments to address the issues identified in (1), (3) rigorously evaluate the performance of your approach, and (4) clearly communicate your findings to a wide audience. <b>The deliverables for this project</b> are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a class="toc" href="#finalreport">Final written report</a> and a draft report prior to final submission</li>
    </ol>
  
    Other topics described in this document related to the project include:

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project is an opportunity to identify and deeply explore a question or problem of your choosing, using machine learning tools. A central component of your project must be a machine learning methodology. It does not have to be one that we've explicitly discussed in class as you're welcome to use the project as an opportunity to learn new topics, although you're welcome to gain greater experience using the techniques from class by putting them into practice. The objectives of this project are to...

      <ol>
        <li>Develop deeper competency in applying machine learning methods in practical applications</li>
        <li>Gain experience in learning more about a topic beyond what was explicitly discussed, but by building on the foundation you have developed throughout the course which enables you to learn about other machine learning concepts</li>
        <li>Expand your data science portfolio</li>
      </ol>
      I strongly encourage you to pick a project that is of genuine interest in some way (e.g. the application, the tools, the dataset, etc.). Learning comes from stretching yourself: this requires that you push yourself into some unfamiliar territory and that is often a challenge and leads to desirable difficulty. Through this struggle is how the best learning happens, but it requires perseverance and that is best achieved when you are able to bring intrinsic motivation to that challenge. Find a topic of interest and embrace the challenge!
    </p>
    <p>There are (at least) three types of projects for you to consider proposing:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Solve a problem.</b> Identify a challenge for which a machine learning technique could be part of a solution and specify what that challenge is, what are the inputs and desired outputs, and how you would measure success and why you would set the specific goal that you did for the project.</li>
        <li><b>Answer a question.</b> Identify a question you're interested to answer using machine learning tools, identify the experiment you would need to run to answer it and using what metrics, and design the experiment to answer the question.</li>
        <li><b>Design a tool.</b> Identify an objective that you wish to accomplish, and build and publish the tool such that you're ready to share it with the world and demo it by the time of your final presentation</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project must involve machine learning techniques or concepts (this could include concepts we were not able to cover in the course, but realize that may increase the challenge of the project.</li>
      <li>The project must be able to be completed within the course of this semester and should be scoped correctly: neither too easy given the number of members of your team, nor too difficult such that you will not have a finished product by semester's end.</li>
      <li>Every project should involve reading about both your application domain and the methods that you're using, especially in technical reports (be wary of content on Medium and blogs). You'll need to provide context for your work, and demonstrate that you've learned more about your project topic through the course of your work.</li>
    </ul>

<div id="finalreport" class="container sec">
  <h2>Final Report</h2>

  <p>The final project report that you submit will consist of two parts: (1) a draft project report and (2) a final report. The draft project report is your main opportunity to get detailed feedback on your report. While the draft report won't be graded, I will provide written feedback and suggestions in the form of Google doc comments that I would strongly recommend addressing in your final report.</p>

  <p>Please find the <a class="emphasis" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dp1LquAQMb09kaeuLBKMSmfwVxX5Upb1ps0mKjPDMOc/edit?usp=sharing">instructions and template for the report here</a>.</p>

  <!-- <h2>Sample project ideas</h2>
  <p><b>Example Project Idea #1: How well buildings be detected in satellite imagery across diverse geographies?</b> Satellite imagery is enabling us to create functional maps of the world based on the content in the images. Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.</p>

  <h2>Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Participate in an active machine learning competition.</b> Online machine learning competitions are sponsored by organizations with a significantly high interest in a problem that they are investing prize money into finding a solution. Examples of competition platforms include <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/">Driven Data</a>, <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions">Zindi</a>, <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/">AICrowd</a>, etc. If you choose to participate in a competition, it must be an active competition where your team can compete; it cannot be a "sample" competition that is only for learning to use the platform (e.g. the Kaggle Titanic competition, etc.). You will want to learn about the application domain.</li>
    <li><b>Design your own project based on a question, e.g. how well buildings be detected in satellite imagery across diverse geographies?</b> Satellite imagery is enabling us to create functional maps of the world based on the content in the images. Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.</li>
    <li><b>Reproduce the work of a published study and build on it.</b> Reproducing the results of a journal article can be a great way to dive into advanced materials. The goal for a project like this would be to reproduce the study and build on it in some way: test a new hypothesis, adjust the methodology, try it on other data that may present new and interesting challenges. Reproducing papers can be hard, so you'll want to choose wisely and make clear what your innovation is.</li>
    <li><b>Build your own tool.</b> Great value can come from making a tool available for use, but building the infrastructure is a challenge. You may want to create a chatbot that creates poetry based on themes that you feed in, or design a search tool that scans satellite data of the Earth for signs of natural disasters. The key here is that your tool will need to be functional and usable by your target audience.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p>As you're developing ideas for your project, explore active competitions on <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/">AICrowd</a>, <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions">Zindi</a>,  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/">DrivenData</a>, and other machine learning competition pages. You can use these competitions as a starting point for a project. Additionally, you may want to be inspired by projects in the community, for example, the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/Pages/ai-repository.aspx">AI for Good repository</a> has a number of projects from which to draw inspiration.</p>

  <p><b>What makes for an interesting dataset to explore?</b> The dataset generally needs to have enough samples, features, and labels to enable a meaningful analysis. This rules out options like the Iris, Titanic, and all other "introductory" datasets for which you can find dozens of numerous tutorials walking through the analysis. You want to be able to journey into the unknown of the data: be bold and pick a dataset and application that excites you!</p>

  <!-- <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Does our project application need to be novel?</h3>
  <p>No. While novel ideas are certainly welcome and encouraged, your project does not need to something that has never been done before. In fact, reproducing a past research paper (from a reputable journal) or exceptional projects can be an excellent way to develop your skills and learn good experimental practices along the way. However, you should not simply take an existing repository, hit "run" and call that your project, of course, you will need to make it your own - ask some additional questions, try to modify the methods, etc.</p> -->
