  <h1>Final Project</h1>
  <h2>Summary and Goals</h2>
    <p>Deep learning tools are not an end in themselves, but yield value when making predictions, quantifying and describing phenomena in the world around us, and in all these ways and more helping us to make decisions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible. For this final project, you will work in teams of 1 or 2 students to (1) identify a problem to solve or a question to answer, (2) apply deep learning techniques to conduct experiments to address the issues identified in (1), (3) rigorously evaluate the performance of your approach, and (4) clearly communicate your findings to a wide audience. <b>The deliverables for this project</b> are:</p>

    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <p>This project is an opportunity to identify and deeply explore a question or problem of your choosing, using deep learning tools. A central component of your project must be a deep learning methodology. It does not have to be one that we've explicitly discussed in class as you're welcome to use the project as an opportunity to learn new topics, although you're welcome to gain greater experience using the techniques from class by putting them into practice. The objectives of this project are to...

      <ol>
        <li>Develop deeper competency in applying deep learning methods in practical applications</li>
        <li>Gain experience in learning more about a topic beyond what was explicitly discussed, but by building on the foundation you have developed throughout the course which enables you to learn about other deep learning concepts</li>
        <li>Increase your experience with collaborative data science workflows</li>
        <li>Expand your data science portfolio</li>
      </ol>
      I strongly encourage you to pick a project that is of genuine interest in some way (e.g. the application, the tools, the dataset, etc.). Learning comes from stretching yourself: this requires that you push yourself into some unfamiliar territory and that is often a challenge and leads to desirable difficulty. Through this struggle is how the best learning happens, but it requires perseverance and that is best achieved when you are able to bring intrinsic motivation to that challenge. Find a topic of interest and embrace the challenge!
    </p>
    <p>There are (at least) three types of projects for you to consider proposing:
      <ol>
        <li><b>Solve a problem.</b> Identify a challenge for which a deep learning technique could be part of a solution and specify what that challenge is, what are the inputs and desired outputs, and how you would measure success and why you would set the specific goal that you did for the project.</li>
        <li><b>Answer a question.</b> Identify a question you're interested to answer using deep learning tools, identify the experiment you would need to run to answer it and using what metrics, and design the experiment to answer the question.</li>
        <li><b>Design a tool.</b> Identify an objective that you wish to accomplish, and build and publish the tool such that you're ready to share it with the world and demo it by the time of your final presentation</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The project must involve deep learning techniques or concepts (this could include concepts we were not able to cover in the course, but realize that may increase the challenge of the project.</li>
      <li>The project must be able to be completed within the course of this semester and should be scoped correctly: neither too easy given the number of members of your team, nor too difficult such that you will not have a finished product by semester's end.</li>
      <li>Every project should involve reading about both your application domain and the methods that you're using, especially in technical reports (be wary of content on Medium and blogs). You'll need to provide context for your work, and demonstrate that you've learned more about your project topic through the course of your work.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<div id="proposal" class="container sec">
  <h2>Proposal</h2>

  <p>Your team will submit a short project proposal. You will receive written feedback that should be used to guide your project development and execution. There are no length requirements. Every proposal should have the title of the project and the list of team members at the top of the first page.</p>

  <p>You can find the <a class="emphasis" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eb7f-wGCmRUSPhDzCAzZXPr5uvufPcTwFkinCVQK250/edit?usp=sharing">project proposal template and instructions here</a>. We recommend you think about and discuss the different points mentioned in the template prior to submission.</p>
  
  <p>Additionally, content from your proposal may be reused in your draft/final report and so you're encouraged to invest in it with that in mind.</p>

  <p>If you are looking for ideas about datasets, etc., please see the <a href="#ideas">Ideas section</a> below. Please stop by office hours if you would like to discuss specific project ideas or for any other help in selecting your project idea.</p>

</div>

<div id="finalreport" class="container sec">
  <h2>Final Report</h2>

  <p>The final project report that you submit will consist of two parts: (1) a draft project report and (2) a final report. The draft project report is your main opportunity to get detailed feedback on your report. While the draft report won't be graded, I will provide written feedback and suggestions in the form of Google doc comments that I would strongly recommend addressing in your final report.</p>

  <p>Please find the <a class="emphasis" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dp1LquAQMb09kaeuLBKMSmfwVxX5Upb1ps0mKjPDMOc/edit?usp=sharing">instructions and template for the report here</a>.</p>

</div>
<div id="presentation" class="container sec">
  <h2>Presentation</h2>

  <p>You will also prepare a 4-to-6 minute presentation summarizing your project. This presentation should be visually compelling and should not miss the “forest for the trees” – don’t get lost in technical details. Imagine your aunt and uncle watching this presentation – would they know what is going on? Would they find it approachable and engaging? For inspiration for what makes a good explanatory presentation, watch videos from the following series:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbfYPyITQ-7l4upoX8nvctg">Two Minute Papers</a> by Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. Concise 1-4 minute summaries of cutting edge research papers.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3Blue1Brown</a> by Grant Sanderson. Mathematical concepts conveyed clearly, intuitively, and visually.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConVfxXodg78Tzh5nNu85Ew">Welch Labs</a> by Stephen Welch. Series on machine learning, neural networks, and imaginary numbers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you're working on preparing your presentation, ask your friends (especially those who may not be as technically inclined) for feedback. Do they think it was engaging/easy to follow? Ask them their takeaways: did they get the message you were trying to communicate? Address their feedback to help you ensure the quality of your presentation. You're encouraged to use the audio-visual medium to the fullest to clearly present your project.  Your presentation will be graded by myself (the professor) as well as your peers (other students), using the following general rubric <b> (presentation rubric link - forthcoming) </b> </p>
</div>

<div id="github" class="container sec">
  <h2>Github Repository</h2>
  <p>Your github respository should (a) contain a descriptive README.md file that explains what the repo is for, and how to use the code to reproduce your work (including how to set it up to run), (b) be well commented throughout all files, (c) list all dependencies in a requirements.txt file, (d) inform the user how to get the data and includes all preprocessing code, and (e) actually runs (i.e. we can successfully test it) and does what it says</p>

  <p>Also include a copy of your final report from the README.md file.</p>

</div>

<div id="presentation" class="container sec">
  <h2>Presentation Quality</h2>
  <p>The grade for your presentation will be a weighted average of the instructor's score (with weight of 66%) and the average score from students (with a weight of 34%).  Everyone (student and instructors) will use a scoring rubric to evaluate your presentation, which will be made available on Moodle shortly <b> (presentation rubric link - forthcoming) </b>. </p>
</div>

<div id="peerevaluation" class="container sec">
<h2>Bonus: Peer Evaluation of Presentations</h2>
  <p> I will grant 0.5 bonus points (equivalent to 2% of a 100% score) for attending each of the last two regular sessions of class (so total 4% bonus), and completing scoring rubrics for all of your classmates' presentations, up to to a maximum of 100% score on the Project</p>
</div>

<div id="evaluation" class="container sec">
  <h2>Submission, Evaluation, & Grading</h2>

  <p>You should submit each deliverable from your project through Moodle. You will submit a link to each team deliverable, except for one. These deliverables should be submitted AS A TEAM not through individual submissions. The project proposal, and draft final report should be submitted through Moodle as links to Google Docs (so that I can attach easy-to-repond-to comments) using the templates provided. The github repo should also both be submitted as links via Moodle. The final project report, however, should be submitted as a PDF document in Moodle.</p>

  <p>The grading for this project will be assigned as follows:</p>
  <table class="table table-hover">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Component</th>
        <th scope="col">Evaluation / Feedback Plan</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Presentation</th>
        <td>5 points, graded</td>
      </tr>

        <td>Required for project submission to be considered complete<sup>**</sup></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th scope="row">Presentation Evaluations</th>
        <td>0.5 bonus points, each, for attendance and completion of presentation evaluations on May 3rd and May 5th, respectively./td>

        <td><b>25 points</b></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><sup>**</sup> No points will be directly assigned. One point will be deducted from your overall final project score for each day late; up to 2 points may be deducted from the overall project score if the deliverable is unsatisfactory (if it does not represent a serious effort towards the deliverable)</p>

  <!-- <h2>Sample project ideas</h2>
  <p><b>Example Project Idea #1: How well buildings be detected in satellite imagery across diverse geographies?</b> Satellite imagery is enabling us to create functional maps of the world based on the content in the images. Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.</p>

  <h2>Ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Participate in an active machine learning competition.</b> Online machine learning competitions are sponsored by organizations with a significantly high interest in a problem that they are investing prize money into finding a solution. Examples of competition platforms include <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/">Driven Data</a>, <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions">Zindi</a>, <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/">AICrowd</a>, etc. If you choose to participate in a competition, it must be an active competition where your team can compete; it cannot be a "sample" competition that is only for learning to use the platform (e.g. the Kaggle Titanic competition, etc.). You will want to learn about the application domain.</li>
    <li><b>Design your own project based on a question, e.g. how well buildings be detected in satellite imagery across diverse geographies?</b> Satellite imagery is enabling us to create functional maps of the world based on the content in the images. Automating building identification could help map global population and analyze global population growth in real-time. However, different parts of the world look different: forests, deserts, plains, etc. Each location looks differently. This may impact the ability to train an algorithm on one location and test on another location. This project uses the INRIA building dataset to investigate the impact of different geographies on the performance of building detection and segmentation techniques using satellite imagery.</li>
    <li><b>Reproduce the work of a published study and build on it.</b> Reproducing the results of a journal article can be a great way to dive into advanced materials. The goal for a project like this would be to reproduce the study and build on it in some way: test a new hypothesis, adjust the methodology, try it on other data that may present new and interesting challenges. Reproducing papers can be hard, so you'll want to choose wisely and make clear what your innovation is.</li>
    <li><b>Build your own tool.</b> Great value can come from making a tool available for use, but building the infrastructure is a challenge. You may want to create a chatbot that creates poetry based on themes that you feed in, or design a search tool that scans satellite data of the Earth for signs of natural disasters. The key here is that your tool will need to be functional and usable by your target audience.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- <p>As you're developing ideas for your project, explore active competitions on <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/">AICrowd</a>, <a href="https://zindi.africa/competitions">Zindi</a>,  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a>, <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/">DrivenData</a>, and other machine learning competition pages. You can use these competitions as a starting point for a project. Additionally, you may want to be inspired by projects in the community, for example, the <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/AI/Pages/ai-repository.aspx">AI for Good repository</a> has a number of projects from which to draw inspiration.</p>

  <p><b>What makes for an interesting dataset to explore?</b> The dataset generally needs to have enough samples, features, and labels to enable a meaningful analysis. This rules out options like the Iris, Titanic, and all other "introductory" datasets for which you can find dozens of numerous tutorials walking through the analysis. You want to be able to journey into the unknown of the data: be bold and pick a dataset and application that excites you!</p>

  <!-- <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Does our project application need to be novel?</h3>
  <p>No. While novel ideas are certainly welcome and encouraged, your project does not need to something that has never been done before. In fact, reproducing a past research paper (from a reputable journal) or exceptional projects can be an excellent way to develop your skills and learn good experimental practices along the way. However, you should not simply take an existing repository, hit "run" and call that your project, of course, you will need to make it your own - ask some additional questions, try to modify the methods, etc.</p> -->
